## 问题描述

There are n soldiers standing in a line. Each soldier is assigned a unique rating value.

You have to form a team of 3 soldiers amongst them under the following rules:

Choose 3 soldiers with index (i, j, k) with rating (rating[i], rating[j], rating[k]).
A team is valid if:  (rating[i] < rating[j] < rating[k]) or (rating[i] > rating[j] > rating[k]) where (0 <= i < j < k < n).
Return the number of teams you can form given the conditions. (soldiers can be part of multiple teams).

 

Example 1:
```
Input: rating = [2,5,3,4,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can form three teams given the conditions. (2,3,4), (5,4,1), (5,3,1). 
```
<!--more-->

Example 2:

```
Input: rating = [2,1,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: We can't form any team given the conditions.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: rating = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 4
```
Constraints:

- n == rating.length
- 1 <= n <= 200
- 1 <= rating[i] <= 10^5

## 解题思路

暴力解法

```javascript
var numTeams = function(rating) {
    var n = rating.length;
    var result = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (var j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
            for (var k = j + 1; k < n; ++k) {
                if (rating[i] < rating[j] && rating[j] < rating[k] || rating[i] > rating[j] && rating[j] > rating[k]) {
                    result++;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return result;
};
```
